        <p>The primary purpose of an expansion card is to provide or expand on features not offered by the motherboard. Nowadays the expansion card isnâ€™t used very often in personal computers as in most cases the motherboard has all the features that the dedicated expansion cards used to take up, although some graphics cards can be imputed in the PCI expansion slots that the expansion cards used to take up.</p>
