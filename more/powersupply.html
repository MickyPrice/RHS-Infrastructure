        <h1>Power Supply</h1>
        <p>
          The power supply converts AC energy to DC so that the computer's components can function, most PC power supplies are around 250-300 Watts although computers that need less or more can get supplies to suit their needs, with gaming PCâ€™s using upto 800 Watt and smaller industry-based PCâ€™s using as little as 50 Watts. A test in 2005 revealed computer power supplies are generally about 70â€“80% efficient. They are rated in a three tier system according to power ane efficiency; bronze, silver and gold. Although a power supply with a larger than needed power rating will have an extra margin of safety against overloading, such a unit is often less efficient and wastes more electricity at lower loads than a more appropriately sized unit. For example, a 900-watt power supply with the 80 Plus Silver efficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 85-percent efficient for loads above 180 W) may only be 73% efficient when the load is lower than 100 W, which is a typical idle power for a desktop computer. Thus, for a 100 W load, losses for this supply would be 37 W; if the same power supply was put under a 450 W load, for which the supplyâ€™s efficiency peaks at 89%, the loss would be only 56 W despite supplying 4.5 times the useful power. For a comparison, a 500-watt power supply carrying the 80 Plus Bronze efficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 82-percent efficient for loads above 100 W) may provide an 84-percent efficiency for a 100 W load, wasting only 19 W.
