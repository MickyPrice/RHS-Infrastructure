        <h1>Hard Drive</h1>
        <p>A hard drive (HD/HDD, if referring to the drive itself) is a drive that uses magnetic fields to store data onto a small metal disk, most; if not all of the computerâ€™s data is stored on one or more hard drives, their storage capacity is usually around 1TB per drive, although they can range from 16GB to 2TB in the same space as a standard drive. These drives are often stored away from other components in the PC as they generate a large amount of heat from running, and they are slowly being succeeded by solid state drives which contain no moving parts.</p>
