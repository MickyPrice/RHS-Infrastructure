        <p>A RAM card is a physical memory storage device that is plugged into a computer's motherboard. The RAM card contains the actual memory chips that store the data being used by the computer, but this data is stored temporarily with the aim it will be used relatively soon in comparison to when it was loaded, such as housing data for a picture your currently working on, on paint. The data will be stored on the cards until you save and exit the program. This memory is used to save hard drive space and speed up the overall computerâ€™s processes</p>
